* Better weights for Valorant and PUBG (PUBG training now, Volarant next week, delayed)
* ~Accurate recoil control for some games (Done for CSGO, available only in pro version)~
* Players can download at different time will get different files (with same file names but content changed)

## Promotion 🎈🎈🎈
* Join our [new Discord](https://discord.gg/qkvkT7y7mZ) for **password** and free trial (one day), where also provide a channel for development discussion
* AIMBOT IS NOT free, join the server for details, but I will also release a free version
* There is a free weights shared previously for people who want to code their own program. Enjoy. (class 0: head; class 1: body, 416*416, Yolov4-tiny)
* Also a slightly modified version of labelimg, with zoom up to 1000% and no fuzzy
* Proof of [work on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyDKoZcyp2vDvskHFviRtag)
